Assignment 4 - Dinosaurs 
===

![alt text](screenshot.PNG)


For Assignment 4, I decided to tap into my childhood dream of becoming a paleontologist. I figured there was a dataset out there containing enough interesting information on dinosaurs for me to put together a visualization with multiple views. I found two datasets, one containing dinosaur's country and fossil location, and the other containing the dinosaur's diet and "clade". I merged these datasets together and set out to make an exploratory dashboard where users could look at dinosaurs through a variety of dimensions.

Technical Achievements

1. Data Gathering/Manipulation - I found two different datasets of dinosaur species and decided both had interesting information. However, the datasets were not set up to be used together initially, so I had to edit the source and parse it intelligently to make it work.
2. Five Views - With the many aspects of dinosaurs, I thought showing more than two views would be worthwhile. Seeing how dinosaur size varies by combinations of location/diet/clade yields a deeper experience for the viewer than just two views.  
3. Map View - One of the views is a geographical map view of the countries of the world, which required finding and loading a Geojson file. I also had to programmatically modify the country data to align with the Geojson features.

Design Achievements

1. Color Scheme - I tried to pick nice colors for diet and the map view (ex. carnivore = red, harbivore = green).
