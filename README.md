This visualization shows the comparative stress levels in each state, with the intensity of the red color indicating stress. The user may hover over any state, which shows a tooltip indicating what state it is. Additionally, there is a donut chart showing how people in the state the user is hovering over deal with their stress.

Technical Achievements

- Mousing off of the map causes the tooltip to fade out over time.

Design Achievements
